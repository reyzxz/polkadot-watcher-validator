## About

The watcher is a nodeJs application meant to be connected with a substrate based node through a web socket.  
It can then monitor the status of the node, leveraging on mechanism such as the builtin heartbeat.

### Monitoring Features

- A validator has been reported for Slash
- A validator is not seleceted by Phragmen alorithm to be part of the active set
- A validator has changed his payout address destination
- A validator has an unexpected payout address destination
- A validator has changed his commission rate
- A validator has an unexpected commission rate

#### Unexpected payout address destination

Possible Payout Destination Types are `'Staked' | 'Stash' | 'Controller' | 'Account' | 'None'`.  
If an expected destination address is specified in the config file, it is implicit that you are expecting a type `'Account'` to be matched.

## Configuration

A sample config file is provided [here](config/main.sample.yaml)

### Validators from Git

The list of your addresses can be dynamically retrieved (app startup/restart) from a Git file. Check the [GitConfigLoader](src/gitConfigLoader) implementation.  

- [GitLab API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/repository_files.html)

### Prometheus

A Prometheus instance can be attached to this application thanks to the endpoint exposed at [/metrics](https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-watcher-validator/blob/master/src/prometheus.ts#L114).  
An Alerting system can be then built on top of that, see [here](charts/polkadot-watcher/templates/alertrules.yaml)

## Deployment 

The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) can be deployed into a Kubernetes cluster thanks to the polkadot-watcher [chart](charts/polkadot-watcher).
